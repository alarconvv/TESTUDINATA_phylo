## Appendix 1

Table of prior and area schemes. Prior schemes and the harmonic mean per estimation. Dispersal probability schemes with their Likelihood per each major clade into Testudines.


---

## Appendix 2

Dispersal Probability matrices. Temporal matrices of dispersal probabilities from the B scheme, which was selected to perform the ancestral area analysis.

## Appendix 3

Total evidence dating of Testudinata. Blue barrier per node correspond to the High-Density probability of the 95%. Letter in the nodes on Testudines clade are the ancestral area, following our suggested regionalization. Color in areas do not correspond a specific pattern. It was the color by default assigned by Biogeobears in every run per clade.
